# Eniac's Extention project
This project was completed as part of the Data Analyst Intensive Bootcamp at WBS coding school. The objective was to analyze data and provide insights to help Eniac determine whether to expand its business in Brazil through Magist.
## Summary
This repository contains an analysis of Eniac, a Spain-based online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, as it explores expansion into the Brazilian market. The project evaluates whether Eniac should partner with Magist, a Brazilian e-commerce retailer based on market dynamics, business feasibility, and strategic fit.

The final deliverable for this project was a 5-minute presentation prepared for Eniac’s CEO, outlining the strategic recommendation. You can find the presentation file attached under "Final Strategic Recommendation_Presentation." 

## Languages and Libraries Used
- **SQL** – For data querying and management  
- **Tableau** – For interactive data visualization  
- **Prezi** – For dynamic presentations  

## Key Learnings
To effectively use SQL and Tableau together, SQL is ideal for exploring data relationships, performing complex queries, and generating quick insights. In this case study, SQL helped analyze table relationships and perform initial calculations efficiently. However, since Magist’s database was relatively simple, with fewer tables to manage, it was more efficient to export the data and conduct the final analysis and visualization in Tableau.
